Description:
heroSlider is a customizable and responsive content slider which provides designers and developers a free and easy way to quickly add scrollable content anywhere to a webpage.

Features
- <strong>Trivial to implement</strong>
    It's as easy as downloading the code and adding a simple call to some content on your page. (see demos below)

- Very customizable
    The extendible stylesheet and suite of options ensures your heroSlider doesn't look the same as everyone else's and can easily be dropped into your custom site.    

- Extendability
    Open source and a properly implemented jQuery plugin (including custom events) allows you to use heroSlider as a baseline and develop the plugin to meet your needs.

- Responsive design
    The plugin is fully responsive, which means you can drop it in to a mobile site or your existing responsive site without any hassle.

Planned Features:
- CSS3 3D Transitions!

Demos:
    Coming shortly
