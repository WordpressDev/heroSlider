## Description
heroSlider is a customizable and responsive content slider which provides designers and developers a free and easy way to quickly add content anywhere to a webpage. There are multiple effects supported to change the slides. heroSlider is also designed to allow you to populate the slides with any content you want, not just images!

## Features

* Trivial to implement
    + It's as easy as downloading the code and adding a simple call to some content on your page. (see demos below)

* Very customizable
    + The extendible stylesheet and suite of options ensures your heroSlider doesn't look the same as everyone else's and can easily be dropped into your custom site.

* Extendability
    + Open source and a properly implemented jQuery plugin (including custom events) allows you to use heroSlider as a baseline and develop the plugin to meet your needs.

* Responsive design
    + The plugin is fully responsive, which means you can drop it in to a mobile site or your existing responsive site without any hassle.

## Planned Features
* CSS3 3D Transitions!
